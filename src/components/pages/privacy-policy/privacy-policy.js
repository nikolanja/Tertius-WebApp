							<br />
							<span>Introduction</span>
							<br />
							<br />
							We are committed to protecting the privacy of your data. This Privacy Policy explains more specifically what information GB Ventures LLC (“Tertius,” “we” or “us”) collect from Account Holders (“you”) through Tertius’s websites and applications, which we refer to collectively as “the Service.” The Service includes the Tertius Software.
							<br />
							<br />
							Although significant changes are rare, this policy may be amended as new features, technology, or legal requirements arise, so please check back from time to time. We’ll notify you if we make a significant change and, where required, seek your consent. 
							<br />
							<br />
							<span>Information Collection</span>
							<br />
							<br />
							We built Tertius to help you remember and organize your favorite literary excerpts, ideas, thoughts, and memories. That means you can input or store in Tertius any text, images, and other data that you choose — we refer to that information as “Content”. We also collect and receive the following types of information:
							<br />
							<br />
							<span>Basic subscriber information.</span> To open your account and process payments, we collect and receive basic information like your email address and, depending on how you purchase a subscription, your billing address and other payment information. 
							<br />
							<br /> 
							<span>Usage data.</span> We collect and log data on how you and others access and use Tertius, for example, the act of capturing an excerpt or creating a comment. Usage data may be collected through cookies, and similar technologies. 
							<br />
							<br />
							<span>Location information.</span> We collect the IP address you use to connect to the Service, and — if you choose to share it — your location information from a mobile device. 
							<br />
							<br />
							<span>Device information.</span> We collect information about the number and type of devices you use to connect to the Service, as well as information about the operating systems on those devices (e.g., iOS, Android, Windows). Learn more about information our applications collect from your device on our Data Usage page.
							<br />
							<br />
							We also may link your subscriber information with data we receive from our partners and other third parties to help understand your needs and provide you with a better experience. For example, if you create or log into a Tertius account using your Google Apps credentials via single sign-on, we will have access to certain information such as your name and email address as authorized in your Google Apps profile settings.
							<br />
							<br />
							<span>Information Use</span>
							<br />
							<br />
							We are committed to protecting the privacy of your information. Below, we describe the ways in which we use the information we collect and receive to provide, maintain, and improve the Service; to provide troubleshooting and customer support; to protect the Service for all our users; and to contact you. 
							<br />
							<br />
							We use a number of technologies to help you get the most out of the Service. Our systems automatically analyze your data to power Tertius features and to continually improve the Service for you in a way that does not require anyone to look at your Content. This may include, for example:
							<br />
							<br />
							1. Making sure you find what you’re looking for when you search your account.
							<br />
							<br />
							2. Suggesting actions for you to take based on information you’ve stored.
							<br />
							<br />
							3. Suggesting Tertius service features or products to you.
							<br />
							<br />
							<span>Information Use Limitations</span>
							<br />
							<br />
							You have control over who sees your Content. We limit the use of your Content to make sure that no one at Tertius can view it unless you expressly give us permission or it’s necessary to comply with our legal obligations. Specifically:
							<br />
							<br />
							1. To help refine or improve the technology, we may ask you for permission to review portions of your Content. Such access to your Content is done only with your express permission and is subject to strict confidentiality rules and data access controls. Choosing to give us such permission is completely voluntary.
							<br />
							<br />
							2. If you contact our Customer Support team for help with specific pieces of Content in your account (for example, if you can’t find a post you believe should be in your account), we may ask for your temporary permission to look at your Content. This permission terminates when the issue is resolved.
							<br />
							<br />
							3. If we become aware of a potential violation of our a Terms of Service, we may suspend or close your account until the problematic material is removed. Under such a circumstance, we would only look at the Content in your account if you give us consent or if necessary to comply with our legal obligations, including to protect the safety of you or any other person.
							<br />
							<br />
							4. To test and improve our product offerings for our users, we use aggregated data that does not contain any personal information, does not identify any person, and cannot be connected to any specific user. This policy is not intended to apply to such anonymized/de-identified data.
							<br />
							<br />
							<span>Information Sharing and Disclosure</span>
							<br />
							<br />
							Tertius is not in the business of selling or renting your information. Here are instances when we may disclose your information — and then only the minimum information necessary:
							<br />
							<br />
							We share your information with Service Providers who process data on our behalf, such as credit card processors and customer management systems. For example, these Service Providers help us:
							<br />
							<br />
							1. Operate, develop, and improve the features and functionality of the Service.
							<br />
							<br />
							2. Complete your payment transactions.
							<br />
							<br />
							3. Fulfill your sales and support requests.
							<br />
							<br />
							4. Communicate with you as described elsewhere in this policy.
							<br />
							<br />
							We require these providers to agree to strict data protection requirements in keeping with our privacy policy standards, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), and our commitments under our EU-US Privacy Shield and Swiss-US Privacy Shield certifications as discussed below. You can view the vendors we use to help us provide the Service on our Vendors page.
							<br />
							<br />
							We do not share your information with any third parties for their own advertising purpose.
							<br />
							<br />
							In the event of a merger, sale, or reorganization of all or part of our business, information covered by this policy may be transferred in connection with that deal. 
							<br />
							<br />
							<span>Information Requests</span>
							<br />
							<br />
							We vigilantly protect the privacy of your account. We will not disclose your information to law enforcement or other governmental authorities unless we believe it is required to comply with warrants, court orders, subpoenas, or other lawful government requests. This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards of due process.
							<br />
							<br />
							We narrowly interpret all information requests, and we only disclose Content in your account that is specifically responsive to a government warrant or where you have provided your explicit consent. In accordance with our user notice policy, we will notify you if we believe we are compelled to comply with a third party’s legal demand for your information.
							<br />
							<br />
							In addition, in rare cases, we may share your information as necessary to investigate or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, or potential threats against persons, property or the systems on which we operate the Service, or as otherwise necessary to comply with our legal obligations.
							<br />
							<br />
							<span>Information Management</span>
							<br />
							<br />
							Consistent with our policy on data protection — your data is yours - in most cases, you can manage your information simply by logging into your account and editing your information directly within the Service.
							<br />
							<br />
							However, if you prefer, you can contact us at support@tertius.app to ask us to provide access to, correct, update, or delete your personal information. Please note that we may ask you for proof of account ownership and/or identity before fulfilling your request. We will comply with such requests to the extent required by applicable law or the US-Swiss Privacy Shield and US-EU Privacy Shield.
							<br />
							<br />
							<span>A Note for our European Users about our Data Processing Grounds and Data Access Rights</span>
							<br />
							<br />
							The European Union's GDPR requires that we provide notice in a specific way to our European users about their privacy rights. We process Account Holder or End User personal information on one of three grounds, depending on the circumstances: (i) your affirmative consent, in which case you will have the right to withdraw consent at any time; (ii) contractual necessity; or (iii) our legitimate interest in providing the Service. In addition, we are required to list the data access right available to all users in a specific way.
							<br />
							<br />
							<span>Information Storage</span>
							<br />
							<br />
							Tertius's mission is to help you remember your favorite literary moments. In order to do that, we make the Content you store in Tertius readily accessible to you, until you make the decision to delete it.
							<br />
							<br />
							If you delete your Content, it will no longer be accessible. The Tertius service’s back-up systems may retain residual copies of your deleted Content for up to one year due to the nature of those systems’ operations.
							<br />
							<br />
							For users who are inactive for extended periods of time, we may close your account to satisfy our obligations under applicable law, and in accordance with our data retention policy.
							<br />
							<br />
							When you sync your computing device with the Service, that data will be replicated on servers maintained in the United States. This means that if you store information in or submit data to the Tertius website or Tertius Software and sync such Tertius Software with the Tertius service, you acknowledge your personal information will be transmitted to, hosted, and accessed in the United States.
							<br />
							<br />
							Data privacy laws or regulations in your home country may differ from, or be more protective than, those in the United States. We will collect, store, and use your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable laws, wherever it is processed.
							<br />
							<br />
							<span>Service Deactivation</span>
							<br />
							<br />
							As described above, you can delete your Content at any time, and you can stop using the Tertius service at any time. Your data is portable. You can export your posts at any time by using the tools provided in the Service.
							<br />
							<br />
							<span>Account Closure</span>
							<br />
							<br />
							If Tertius deactivates your account due to a TOS violation, then you may contact us to request deletion of your Content, and we will evaluate such requests on a case by case basis, pursuant to our legal obligations.
							<br />
							<br />
