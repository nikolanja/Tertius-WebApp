							<br />
							<br />
							Welcome to Tertius! We invite you to access our application and website and use the Tertius service, but please note that your invitation is subject to your agreement with these Terms of Service. This document describes in detail your rights and our rights relating to the provision of the Service (as defined below), so please review these Terms carefully.
							<br />
							<br />
							The Terms of Service constitutes a contract between Tertius and you. The Terms include the provisions set forth in this document and in the Tertius Privacy Policy presented by us and accepted by you from time to time in connection with specific Service offerings (all of which we collectively refer to as the “Terms of Service” or “Terms”). If you do not agree to these Terms, you do not have the right to access or use our Service. If you do register for or otherwise use our Service you shall be deemed to confirm your acceptance of the Terms and your agreement to be a party to this binding contract. 
							<br />
							<br />
							By using the Service, you acknowledge, accept and agree with all provisions of the Privacy Policy, including, without limitation, the use and treatment of the text, images, and other data you choose to input, upload, or store in Tertius (collectively, “Content”) and your personal information in accordance with such Privacy Policy.
							<br />
							<br />
							<span>The Service</span>
							<br />
							<br />
							The Tertius Software (as defined below), the Tertius service, and other products, services and websites hosted or made available by Tertius, including, for example our app and help pages are collectively referred to in these Terms as the “Service”. In exchange for being enabled to use the Service, you agree to abide by these Terms.
							<br />
							<br />
							<span>The Parties</span>
							<br />
							<br />
							You, the Account Holder, are one party to this contract. (An Account Holder is the person or entity who has contracted with Tertius as either a user or as a Customer.) 
							<br />
							<br />
							The other party to this contract is GB Ventures LLC, a company headquartered in Michigan, United States. Tertius, as applicable, may be referred to in these Terms of Service as “Tertius,” “we” and sometimes “us”).
							<br />
							<br />
							<span>Change Notifications</span>
							<br />
							<br />
							These Terms may be amended as new features, technology, or legal requirements arise, so please check back from time to time. If we make a significant change, we’ll notify you and, where required, seek your consent.
							<br />
							<br />
							If we do update these Terms, you are free to decide whether to accept the updated terms or to stop using our Service; your continued use of the Service after the effectiveness of that update will be deemed to represent your agreement with, and consent to be bound by, the new Terms.
							<br />
							<br />
							<span>Use Conditions</span>
							<br />
							<br />
							You need to create a Tertius service account. You create an account by providing us with an email address and creating a password. We refer to this as your “Subscriber Information”. You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy, completeness and confidentiality of your Subscriber Information, and you will be responsible for all activities that occur under your account, including activities of others to whom you have provided your Subscriber Information. We will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to provide us with accurate information or to keep your Subscriber Information secure. If you discover any unauthorized use of your Basic Subscriber Information or suspect that anyone may be able to access your private Content without authorization, you should immediately change your password and notify our Customer Support team.
							<br />
							<br />
							You will need to access your account through a web br /owser or by installing our software application on your phone. Obtaining those devices and paying for their connectivity and data plans is your responsibility. Tertius also has no responsibility for the availability of the Internet and other telecommunication services necessary to access the Service.
							<br />
							<br />
							<span>Shared Accounts</span>
							<br />
							<br />
							Tertius service accounts should not be shared. If you share your Subscriber Information with anyone, that other person may be able to take control of the account, and we may not be able to determine who is the proper Account Holder. We will not have any liability to you (or anyone you share your Subscriber Information with) as a result of your or their actions under those circumstances. Since you may use a free Tertius service account (trial), we strongly urge you not to share your information with anyone, unless you are doing so as part of your estate planning purposes, as discussed below.
							<br />
							<br />
							<span>Your Rights in the Tertius Service</span>
							<br />
							<br />
							Once your account is created and you accept these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive license to use the Service subject to these Terms, for so long as you are not barred from receiving the Service under the laws applicable to you, until you close your account voluntarily or until we close your account pursuant to these Terms. In addition, we grant you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the Tertius Software provided to you by or on behalf of Tertius, for the sole purpose of enabling you to use the Tertius Software and enjoy the benefit of the Service, subject to any applicable license terms provided with the Tertius Software and these Terms, until your rights are terminated in accordance with such license and/or these Terms. You do not obtain any other right or interest in Tertius or the Service.
							<br />
							<br />
							<span>Data Protection Rights</span>
							<br />
							<br />
							You retain copyright and any other rights you already held in your Content before you submitted, posted or displayed it on or through the Service. But you do have to grant Tertius a limited license, as described below, so we can make your data accessible and usable on the Service. Other than this limited license and other rights you grant in these Terms, Tertius acknowledges and agrees that we do not obtain any right, title or interest from you under these Terms in any of your Content.
							<br />
							<br />
							In order to enable Tertius to operate the Service, we must obtain from you certain limited license rights to process your Content that is covered by intellectual property rights so that technical actions we take in operating the Service are not considered legal violations. For example, copyright laws could prevent us from processing, maintaining, storing, backing-up and distributing certain Content, unless you give us these rights. Accordingly, by using the Service and uploading Content, you are granting Tertius a license to display, perform and distribute your Content and to modify (for technical purposes, e.g., making sure content is viewable on smartphones as well as computers and other devices) and reproduce such Content to enable Tertius to operate the Service. You also agree that Tertius has the right to elect not to accept, post, store, display, publish or transmit any Content in our sole discretion. 
							<br />
							<br />
							You agree that these rights and licenses are royalty free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide and irrevocable (for so long as your Content is stored with us), and include a right for Tertius to make such Content available to, and pass these rights along to, others with whom Tertius has contractual relationships related to the provision of the Service, solely for the purpose of providing such services, and to otherwise permit access to or disclose your Content to third parties if Tertius determines such access is necessary to comply with its legal obligations.
							<br />
							<br />
							If you elect to use any third party service or application that is integrated with Tertius, you also agree that the licenses granted to Tertius in the preceding paragraph shall apply to Content that is submitted or uploaded through such third party service or application. If the third party service or application you elect to use would access or extract Content, you grant Tertius the right and license to enable third party access to and extraction of your Content. Tertius does not assume any responsibility for, or liability on account of, the actions or omissions of such third party applications or service providers.
							<br />
							<br />
							As we rely upon your rights to upload and distribute your Content, you represent and warrant to Tertius that (1) you have the unfettered legal rights and authority to submit your Content to Tertius, to make any other use, publication or other distribution of that Content in your use of the Service, and to grant the rights granted to Tertius under these Terms; and (2) your Content complies with these Terms.
							<br />
							<br />
							You understand and agree that Tertius, in performing the required technical steps to provide the Service to our users, may make such changes to your Content as are necessary to conform and adapt that Content to the technical requirements of connecting networks, devices, services or media. 
							<br />
							<br />
							<span>User Responsibility</span>
							<br />
							<br />
							Your use of the Service must be in accordance with these Terms. When it comes to your use of the Service, you agree that you are responsible for your own conduct and all conduct under your account. This means all Content created, transmitted, stored or displayed in your account, is your sole responsibility as the person who created the Content or introduced it into the Service. This applies whether the Content is kept private, shared or transmitted using the Service or any third-party application or services integrated with the Tertius service. If we find that any shared Content in your account violates our Terms of Service (including by violating another person’s intellectual property or privacy rights), we reserve the right to un-share or take down such content.
							<br />
							<br />
							<span>Our Content Rights, Intellectual Property and Modifications</span>
							<br />
							<br />
							<span>CONTENT RIGHTS.</span> While you own the Content you store within the Tertius service (subject to third party rights), you acknowledge and agree that Tertius (and our licensors) own(s) all legal right, title and interest in and to the Service, including, without limitation, all software that is part of the Service and all Tertius software deployed by you or a third party to enable capturing of Content originating outside the Service, such as Tertius Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Tertius Speech-to-Text voice recognition or any of the Tertius software applications for compatible computing devices that enable access and use of the Service through such device (the “Tertius Software”).
							<br />
							<br />
							<span>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.</span> In agreeing to these Terms, you also agree that the rights in the Service and Tertius Software, including all intellectual property rights, such as trademarks, patents, designs and copyrights, are protected by one or more of copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, regulations and treaties, in addition to these Terms and any Separate Agreement. In particular, you agree to not modify, create derivative works of, decompile or otherwise attempt to extract source code from any Tertius Software, unless you are expressly permitted to do so under an open source license, we give you express written permission or you are otherwise legally permitted to do so notwithstanding this prohibition. 
							<br />
							<br />
							<span>RIGHT TO MODIFY THE SERVICE.</span> We retain the right, in our sole discretion, to implement new elements as part of and/or ancillary to the Service, including changes that may affect the previous mode of operation of the Service or Tertius Software. We expect that any such modifications will enhance the overall Service, but it is possible that you may not agree with us. We also reserve the right to establish limits to the nature or size of storage available to you, the number of captures or transmissions, the ability to send or receive email messages, the nature or size of any index or libr /ary information, the nature of, or your continued ability to access or distribute, your Content and other data, and impose other limitations at any time, with or without notice.
							<br />
							<br />
							You also acknowledge that a variety of Tertius actions may impair or prevent you from accessing your Content or using the Service at certain times and/or in the same way, for limited periods or permanently, and agree that Tertius has no responsibility or liability as a result of any such actions or results, including, without limitation, for the deletion of, or failure to make available to you, any Content. You agree that we shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of any part of the Service. However, if you are a subscriber and find that any such modifications or interruption of the Paid Service adversely affects you, you may notify our Customer Support team, explain the adverse impact the modification has created and, if you desire, request a termination of your Paid Service. Upon receipt of any such request, we will endeavor to promptly remedy the adverse impact caused by the modification, extend the duration of your Paid Service subscription for a period of time equal to the interruption and/or refund a portion of your Paid Service subscription fee equal to the remaining unused term of the Paid Service subscription, as we determine appropriate or as may be required by applicable law.
							<br />
							<br />
							<span>RIGHT TO ENGAGE THIRD PARTIES.</span> Tertius engages certain affiliates or other third parties (“Service Providers”) to provide technical or other services relating to all or part of the Service, and you hereby agree that such involvement by these Service Providers is acceptable. In addition, Tertius may contract with third party resellers of the Service and payment processors to enable payments in your local currency and payment systems. Please see our Privacy Policy to understand the extent to which any affiliate or third party may have access to your account information or Content to understand our relationship with any reseller or payment processor. 
							<br />
							<br />
							<span>RIGHT TO USE THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE.</span> Tertius may from time to time include as part of the Service and Tertius Software computer software supplied by third parties which is utilized by permission of the respective licensors and/or copyright holders on the terms provided by such parties. We provide information about some of this third party software here and within the particular Tertius Software. Tertius expressly disclaims any warranty or other assurance to you regarding such third party software. 
							<br />
							<br />
							<span>RIGHT TO UPDATE OUR SOFTWARE.</span> In connection with any modification of the Service, Tertius may automatically download software updates on your computers and devices from time to time with the intention of improving, enhancing, repairing and/or further developing the Service. Tertius will endeavor to provide you with the option of whether or not to install the update; however, in certain circumstances (e.g., security risks), Tertius may require you to install the update to continue accessing the Service. In all cases, you agree to permit Tertius to deliver these updates to you (and you to receive them) as part of your use of the Service.
							<br />
							<br />
							<span>Copyright or Other Intellectual Property Violations</span>
							<br />
							<br />
							We respond to clear and complete notices of alleged infringement of copyright, trademark or other intellectual property laws that satisfy the requirements in these Terms (which we believe to comply with the United States Digital Millennium Copyright and other applicable laws). If you believe that your intellectual property rights have been violated, please notify our support team. Note that each owner of intellectual property is responsible for protecting their rights and taking any legal or other action they determine to be appropriate to do so, and Tertius does not accept any obligation to take any particular action to enforce or protect any party’s intellectual property rights on their behalf.
							<br />
							<br />
							<span>Minors</span>
							<br />
							<br />
							Tertius is not directed to minors, and any use by minors should only be done with the guidance, supervision and consent of their parents, guardians and/or authorized school officials. Further, we rely on parents and guardians to ensure minors only use the Service if they can understand their rights and responsibilities as stated in these Terms and our Privacy Policy.
							<br />
							<br />
							Consistent with applicable law, Tertius does not knowingly collect personal information from minors without parental consent. If we learn that we have inadvertently obtained information in violation of applicable laws prohibiting collection of information from children without such consent, we will promptly delete it. 
							<br />
							<br />
							<span>Data Storage</span>
							<br />
							<br />
							The Service is available worldwide, but your data is stored in the United States, as described in our Privacy Policy. If you use the Service, you acknowledge that you may be sending electronic communications (including your Subscriber Information and Content), through computer networks owned by Tertius, its Service Providers, and other third parties located in Michigan and other locations in the United States and other countries. As a result, your use of the Service will likely result in interstate and possibly international data transmissions, and your use of the Service shall constitute your consent to permit such transmissions.
							<br />
							<br />
							<span>Account Closure</span>
							<br />
							<br />
							You may deactivate your account with our Service at any time, for any reason (or no reason). However, if you want to deactivate your account you need to take certain specific steps, which are described in our help desk articles. 
							<br />
							<br />
							Tertius may act to temporarily limit your use of the Service, suspend access to your account, or close your account, with or without notice according to these Terms. Reasons for Tertius suspending or closing your account may include, without limitation: (i) br /each or violation of these Terms or any Separate Agreement, (ii) an extended period of inactivity (determined in Tertius’s sole discretion), (iii) your nonpayment of any fees or other sums due Tertius or any other party related to your use of the Service, (iv) the discontinuance or material modification of the Service (or any part thereof) or (v) unexpected technical or security issues or problems or extensive Unsupported Use.
							<br />
							<br />
							In most cases, in the event we elect to close your account, we will provide at least 30 days advance notice to you at the email address you have provided to us, so you have a chance to retrieve any Content stored on the Service servers (unless we determine that we are legally prohibited from providing such notice or enabling you to do so). After the expiration of this notice period, you will no longer be able to retrieve Content contained in that account or otherwise use the Service through that account.
							<br />
							<br />
							<span>Death and/or Incapacity</span>
							<br />
							<br />
							Tertius’s pledge to protect the privacy of your Content will continue, even after your death or incapacity. If you wish to enable someone to have access to your Content or other data in your account after you are no longer able to provide them access, you need to implement a process for providing your information to them. We will not provide your information, or your Content, to anyone, even next of kin, unless we determine that we are legally obligated to do so. We encourage you to include your Subscriber information, with instructions on how to access your Content, in your will or other estate plans, so that anyone you wish to have access to your account will have the means to do so.
							<br />
							<br />
							<span>Ideas, Suggestions and Proposals</span>
							<br />
							<br />
							When you submit any ideas, suggestions, documents and/or proposals relating to the Service (or other products or services) to Tertius through our Support interfaces or through any other channel or mechanism (collectively, “Contributions”), you acknowledge and agree that: (i) your Contributions do not contain confidential or proprietary information; (ii) Tertius is not under any obligation of confidentiality, express or implied, with respect to the Contributions; (iii) Tertius shall be entitled to use or disclose (or choose not to use or disclose) such Contributions for any purpose, in any way; (iv) Tertius may have something similar to the Contributions already under consideration or in development; (v) your Contributions automatically become the property of Tertius without any obligation of Tertius to you; and (vi) you are not entitled to any accounting, compensation or reimbursement of any kind from Tertius under any circumstances.
							<br />
							<br />
							<span>Advertisements</span>
							<br />
							<br />
							Our business model is to make the Service so valuable that our users will want to subscribe to a Paid Service. However, we may display advertisements and promotions on or in connection with the Service, some of which may be paid for by third parties. For more information, please see our Privacy Policy. 
							<br />
							<br />
							Some advertising or other messaging content we provide will be based upon information provided by third parties, and we shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred by you as a result of any advertisements or other messages. Furthermore, your interactions with advertisers found on or through the Service, including, without limitation, all reliance upon advertising, all commercial transactions and legal obligations associated therewith, are solely between you and such advertisers.
							<br />
							<br />
							<span>Third-Party Links, Indemnity, Limitation of Liability</span>
							<br />
							<br />
							<span>THIRD-PARTY LINKS, CONTENT AND PROGRAMMING.</span> We may include or recommend third party resources, materials and developers and/or links to third party websites, content and applications as part of, or in connection with, the Service. We may have little or no control over such sites or developers and, accordingly, you acknowledge and agree that (i) we are not responsible for the availability of such external sites, content or applications; (ii) we are not responsible or liable for any content or other materials or performance available from such sites or applications and (iii) we shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content, materials or applications. 
							<br />
							<br />
							<span>INDEMNITY.</span> You agree to indemnify and hold Tertius, its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, employees, advertisers, Service Providers and other partners harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages (actual and consequential), losses and expenses (including legal and other professional fees) arising from or in any way related to any third party claims relating to your use of any of the Service, any violation of these Terms of Service or any other actions connected with your use of the Service (including all actions taken under your account). In the event of such claim, we will endeavor to provide notice of the claim, suit or action to the contact information we have for the account, provided that any failure to deliver such notice to you shall not eliminate or reduce your indemnification obligation hereunder.
							<br />
							<br />
							<span>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.</span> To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Service Is Available “As Is.” YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT:
